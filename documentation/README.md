## Interactive markdown script to investigate the model expansion 

within this folder you'll find the 20241231_investigate_multiple... script.
It is an interactive matlab script and allows for the investigation of the model expansion happening in scFastcormics with a toy model or alternatively with the recon3d model which is also loaded in the Runningexample.



## Explaining the workflow of model expansion in scFastcormics

This figure explains how in scfastcormics the model is expanded to account for multiple cell populations: 
Code for this figure: compute_expanded_input_mode

This is the vision on how to expand the existing workframe for scfastcormics in order to be able to account for more then one compartment.
